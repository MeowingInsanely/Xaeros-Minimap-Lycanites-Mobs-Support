# Xaeros-Minimap-Lycanites-Mobs-Support
(WIP) Adds [Lycanites Mobs](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lycanites-mobs/) icons in (xaero minimap)[https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/xaeros-minimap]'s entity radar

**Thanks to [babybluetit](https://github.com/babybluetit/Xaeros-Minimap-Modded-Support) for their guide on how to make icons for the minimap :D**

I made this separate from babybluetit's repository due to the sheer amount of mobs and variety the mod contains.
All Icons were made from the in-game textures or/and the beastiary icons.

## Plans
- Add support to [Lycanites Redux](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/lycanites-redux) Icons
